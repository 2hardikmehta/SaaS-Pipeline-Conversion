# SaaS-Pipeline-Conversion
Assignment – Part I – Understanding the problem
Based on the problem statement framed in the previous segment, you have to build the following frameworks around the problem:

5W: Prepare answers to the questions WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE and HOW around the problem.
SPIN selling framework: Frame at least three questions under each attribute of the SPIN framework. You may refer to the video above for ideas.
 

Complete the first part of the ‘SaaS Project Template’ provided to you.

 

Assignment – Part II – Hypothesis Formulation
After understanding the problem, the next part is to formulate hypotheses. Based on the problem faced by TechnoServe, use a suitable framework to formulate multiple hypotheses covering all the dimensions of the problem. You can use the information provided under the 5 WHYs in the previous segment to divide the problem into branches and formulate hypotheses.
The solution should have:

The framework used to break the problem;
The reasons for choosing the framework;
The structure of how the problem has been broken down using the framework (a screenshot of the flow can be taken using coggle); and 
A list of possible hypotheses that can be formulated under each branch (to be provided in the text even if attached in the screenshot). It should include all the hypotheses that can be formulated, and not just the ones you feel are of high priority. Failing to do so might result in you losing marks.
 
This is the second part of the ‘SaaS Project Template’. Following are the key points that you must consider before the final submission:

The framework must follow the MECE rule.
Hypotheses must be prioritised based on the information provided. If information is not available, assign priority based on suitable assumptions (P0 = highest, P4 = lowest).
There should be at least 10 hypotheses overall, and each branch should have at least one hypothesis.
Assignment – Part III – Generate Insights and Present Findings
After formulating hypotheses, you must validate them. The data set has been provided to you (attached below). The accompanying data dictionary explains the variables that are available in the main data set.
Note

A look at the given data set will show that you might not be able to use it to validate all your hypotheses formulated so far. Therefore, you must focus only on those variables that you believe would generate some interesting insights in Part III of the assignment, thereby helping you formulate your final recommendation.
Also, note that you do not need to revisit and modify Part II of your assignment. The hypothesis formulation exercise is meant to generate an exhaustive list of hypotheses; they need not be similar to those indicated by the data available. You will not be evaluated based on the data set for Part II of the assignment.
 

A look into the data set will give you several interesting variables like ‘Technology Primary’, ‘City’, ‘Opportunity Status’, etc. The ‘Opportunity Status’ column is our primary interest since it explains whether the lead was converted or not: ‘won’ indicates that the leads were converted, whereas ‘lost’ indicates that we failed to convert the leads.

 

By analysing the data, you have to determine the factors that affect the lead conversion rate the most. Based on that information, you should offer suitable recommendations to TechnoServe. For this, you have to assess how other factors, like Client Revenue Sizing, Location, etc., affect the lead conversion rate, which is ‘Opportunity Status’.


(Hint: Take a look at the deliverables part below to select the variables that you need to analyse) 


Your primary objective here would be to find the ideal revenue opportunity in each of these categories and offer recommendations from your final findings. The deliverables for this part of the assignment are as follows:

 

Part III-A

The deliverables for this part of the assignment are as follows:
Analyse the variables using the generative technique for insights: create new columns, summarise rows, apply the five patterns of insights and check whether this generates something useful or interesting. 
Summarise the results in the format mentioned in the PPT. Mention the variables that you would analyse, the insights that you get and the pattern of the insights, if any. For this part, also make sure you include the following five variables in your analysis: ‘Technology Primary’, ‘B2B Sales Medium’, ‘Client Revenue Sizing’, ‘Opportunity Sizing’ and ‘Business from Client last year’. Then, observe the variation of the lead conversion rate across these categories. You are advised to analyse other variables as well.
For each analysis that yields a pattern of insight, the results must be explained on the next slide. The Excel analysis for each part can be done in the data set file itself. The Excel file must be shared along with the PPT in a zipped folder. Make sure you create a new sheet for each analysis and name the sheets according to the names of the variables that you are analysing.
Finally, once you have explained your insights, suggest suitable recommendations and summarise them on the final slide of Part III-A in the mentioned format.
 

Part III-B

The deliverables for this part of the assignment are as follows:
For the last part of this project, you are required to present your findings to the CEO of TechnoServe along with the final recommendations.
Structure your findings in the final three slides (you can use more, if necessary) using the concepts learnt in documenting insights, visualisation and storytelling. Make sure you include basic nuances like the Pyramid Principle, necessary visualisations that portray your analyses, and, finally, the concepts of visual design principles and storyboarding.
